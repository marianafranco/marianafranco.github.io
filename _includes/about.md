I'm a Brazilian hacker girl living in Munich, the Beer Capital of the World :-)

I have a Master of Science in Computer Engineering from [Escola Politécnica da USP](http://www.poli.usp.br/), a top University in Brazil, and my research areas were Multi-Agent Systems and AI.

Currently, I'm working as a remote Software Engineer for [Rainforest QA](www.rainforestqa.com), and when I'm not hacking some code or ~~drinking beer~~ learning German, I like to travel, play video games, read technical and non technical books, watch TV series and to support my favorite soccer team, the <i>Timão!</i>
